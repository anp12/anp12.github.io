abstract: Competitiveness and cohesion have often been considered mutually exclusive variables. This research explores the relationship between these variables and finds results suggesting a positive relationship between trait competitiveness and group cohesion. An experiment was conducted to help explain these counterintuitive findings. The author argues this relationship can be attributed to the competitive focus of the individuals within the sales organization. The article intends to fill a previous gap in the literature by addressing the importance of competitive focus as a moderating variable in the competitive-cohesive relationship.
