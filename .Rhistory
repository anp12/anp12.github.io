abstract: Despite the large body of research that examines the determinants of salesperson performance,significant variation exists regarding how scholars can operationalize salesperson performance using secondary, firm-provided data. Moreover, this variation often exists without explanation or justification. We explore the issue in three parts. First, we conduct an exploratory practitioner survey to discover various salesperson performance operationalizations (SPOs) in use by salespeople and sales managers. Second, using a carefully constructed and theoretically driven evaluative framework, we conduct a systematic review of the literature on salesperson performance that encompasses over thirty years of empirical research on the subject; this review allows us to better understand the SPOs that scholars use. Third, we compare these practitioner and scholarly perspectives to create a comprehensive conceptual model of the different types of SPOs. The model highlights theoretical insights and provides guidance to scholars, reviewers, and practitioners related to the selection of appropriate SPOs for meeting specific research objectives.

summary: The authors take an in depth look at salesperson performance by incorporating practitioner and academic perceptions of salesperson performance. The authors reconcile the two perspectives to better define salesperson performance and provide guidance to scholars regarding the most appropriate salesperson performance operationalization for the research question at hand.
