# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: Technology has always challenged retail sales, with AI being the latest threat. Some predict the end of retail salespeople, but we argue that humans and technology complement each other in enhancing the customer experience. AI improves consistency, efficiency, and multitasking, while humans excel at relationships, creativity, and ethics. We propose a synergistic future where AI and humans work together, with humans ultimately prevailing in delivering a superior customer experience. We provide examples of retailers embodying this synergy and assess them through the "seven Cs" of customer experience. We conclude with managerial considerations and future research directions.
