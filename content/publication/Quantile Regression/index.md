# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: The authors introduce a strobelight analysis as a way to assess relationship inconsistency. Traditional methods like linear regression and structural equation modeling provide estimates that are conditioned on the mean. Quantile regression offers a more flexible way of looking at the relationship to assess portions of the relationship that may vary relative to the mean. By identifying these inconsistencies, authors can offer more nuanced guidance to managers. To assist with the strobelight analysis, the authors developed a user-friendly web application.
