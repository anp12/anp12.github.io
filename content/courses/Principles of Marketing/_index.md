Below are a few reviews of Alec from students...

* **"Although he's young and this is his first real teaching experience, Alec is the man. He's very well spoken, makes the material even easier to understand with his examples/dialogue, and actually cares about his students. He has no issues taking the time to thoroughly explain something, and gives the extra effort to his students when needed. He is very well respected by the entire class, he communicates very well, and he's an inspirational/motivative person."**

* **"Prof Alec really went above and beyond to educate students. His lecture were clear and effective. It was easy to see that he genuinely cared about educating students. He personally helped me work through questions and was one of the best teachers I have had. Give this man a promotion!"**

* **"Professor Pappas did an excellent job teaching this class. Not only did he explain the content very well and answer any questions thoroughly, he went above and beyond in making us think critically about our futures unlike any Professor I've ever had. The knowledge, tips, and advice he has given us will be something we will all take into our futures and use to excel. Thank you Professor!"**
